What is the result of compiling and evaluating 1 + 2 * 3 - 4?

Syntax error. Type error. -3 -1 3 <code>3</code> - correct 5
As most programming languages, OCaml follows the usual priority rules in arithmetic expressions. This expression is read as: 1 + (2 * 3) - 4.
What is the result of compiling and evaluating 10 / 3 * 3?

Syntax error. Type error. 1 1.111111 9 <code>9</code> - correct 10
The / and * operators are left associative. It means that this expression is read as: (10 / 3) * 3.
The / operator is the integer division.
What is the result of compiling and evaluating 42 + 73 mod 5 * 2?

Syntax error. Type error. 0 5 10 90 48 <code>48</code> - correct
The mod operator computes the rest of the integer division. It is one of the rare infix operators composed only of alpha-numerical characters. It has a higher priority than other arithmetic operators, and this expression is read as: 42 + ((73 mod 5) * 2).

What is the result of compiling and evaluating 2 + 3 * 4 - 5?

Syntax error. Type error. -5 -1 9 <code>9</code> - correct 15
This expression is read as: 2 + (3 * 4) - 5.
What is the result of compiling and evaluating 5 * 4 / 3 - 2?

Syntax error. Type error. 3 4 <code>4</code> - correct 4.66666 20
This expression is read as: ((5 * 4) / 3) - 2, and the integer division of 20 by 3 is 6.
What is the result of compiling and evaluating 11 / 4 * 4 + 11 mod 4?

Syntax error. Type error. 3 3.6875 11 14 <code>14</code> - incorrect
This expression is read as: ((11 / 4) * 4) + (11 mod 4), which is equal to (2 * 4) + 3.
